This AppleScript selects an AirPlay output device for OS X, opens iTunes and starts playing a shuffled playlist. 

It was initially based on Ben Dodson's work, but I've decided to rewrite the script from scratch. 
Visit http://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/10/the-airplay-alarm-clock-turning-an-apple-tv-or-airport-express-into-an-alarm-clock-with-applescript/ to learn more about his version and to get a great introduction to AppleScript. 


Instructions
============

This script is compatible with iTunes 12.2 
To use it you'll first need to allow AppleScript to make keypresses on your behalf. Open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy - Privacy - Accessibility. 

If you want to play songs from Apple Music or iTunes Match, make sure to download them first. 

Note: This version changes the main output device of OS X. Hold down Option and click on Volume Control in OS X's menu bar to select another output device.
